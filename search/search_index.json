So we will ad the sur-roundings of the campus to the background. For this you need an image of the surrounding ar-ea. You could take this from QGIS, OSM, Google, etc. you can find an image. Save that image and simply drag it into your Blender viewport (no georeferencing), the image will be placed per-fectly in front of you.</p> <p>Since you want the reference to be on the ground in this case, make sure you are looking at the model perfectly from above (see step 3.).

But since the OSM uses a different coordinate system, first the road network needs to be converted to RD new. Because if you use buffer with another co-ordinate system, the dimensions will not be correct. The easiest way to do this is by right click-ing the road layer and press <code>Export -&gt; Save Features As\u2026</code> Give it a logical file name and make sure that the CRS is set to RD new, then press OK. You can now delete the old road layer (you do not have to apply the changes).</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Now the road network would be ready to have the buffer applied, however, not every road type has the same width. So, the width of a road will be decided by its attributes. The attributes of a feature can be found by pressing the Identify Features button in the Toolbar. Then click on one of the roads for example on the Hengelosestraat. To the right, you can see that features attrib-utes. At the bottom, you can see that this road has a maxspeed of 50 and is a primary road. We will select on those attributes.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the Attribute table of the road layer, select by expression and full in the previously decides at-tributes. The following code can be used: <code>\"maxspeed\" = '50' AND \"highway\" = 'primary' AND \u201cBuffered\u201d is NULL</code>.

Decide on a distance of the road, which should be half the total width you want it to be. You could for example use google earth to measure the distance on the satellite image. Also set the End cap style to flat and press run.

Creating a building using basic modelling tools in Blender","text":"<p>In this chapter, you will use the output blender file from the QGIS to Blender tutorial and use that foundation to create a building. You are expected to use the methods discussed in the previous two tutorials to do this. This chapter will not be a step-by-step tutorial, instead I implore you to be creative and experi-ment with modelling the building. If you are stuck, look at this chapter as a guide and use it as inspira-tion. 1.  Since the building is now 2D, you first want to add height to the building. So, select the building object, enter edit mode, select all faces, and extrude it up. You can use the extrude settings to precisely decide on the height of a floor since it is easiest to do this for each floor. So, if you want a floor to be 4 meters high, you set the Move Z to (-)4. Extrude it by 4 meters for as many floors as you want. </p> <pre><code>![](./Images/ib-21.png)\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>You could also only extrude certain parts of the model to create some parts of the buildings that are higher than others to add some more interesting parts to the building. Since you can only ex-trude complete faces, you might want to add some loop cuts and move them around to create smaller faces to add a floor to. Tip: if you want to see the lengths of the edges enable them in the overlay settings.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Since the water must leave the inside, the bottom floor of that level must be deleted. To do that, select the face at the underside of the building, extrude them up by the height of your floors and in the extrude settings, enable \u201cDissolve Orthogonal Edges\u201d to have Blender automatically delete the \u201cfloating\u201d walls. If that doesn\u2019t do the trick, you can manually delete the faces by selecting the bottom edge and deleting it. Don\u2019t forget that you can move the camera to your selection by pressing \u201c.\u201d on the numpad or in the toolbar press View -&gt; Frame Selected.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>This method can generate some double vertexes; therefore, it is wise to often merge the vertex-es that overlap. This can be done by selecting everything using A, pressing M and select By Dis-tance, this tool merges all vertexes that are within a certain distance. In the settings tab that pops us, make sure that the Merge Distance is not too large since this will merge vertexes that you do not want to merge.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now would be a good time to assign the first materials, to give yourself an easier job, make sure that you colour each material differently</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Let\u2019s now add windows, you can do this by selecting only the horizontal edges of a side and subdivide it as many times as you like. To make it yourself easier, already apply a new material to your selection. This way you will have a separate material for the frames of the windows. To do this afterwards takes a lot of time. Then inset the new windows, enable the \u201cIndividual\u201d setting and assign the selection to a new material for glass. Depth greatly enhances a model, so you can add depth to the model by extruding certain parts, for example, set the glass a bit back. Do this for all sides where you want windows or doors. Try to vary with materials, think about this in advance.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Now that the basic building is done, you can add additional details like an entrance etc.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>When you have finished your building, do not forget to check if all the faces are orientated cor-rectly and use smart UV unwrap to correct the UV\u2019s. Also remove excessive vertexes using merge by distance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now the building can be exported, you can export to many file types, but the programs you will use the FXB format. Export the building by selecting the object and go to File -&gt; Export -&gt; FBX (.fbx). Check the \u201cSelected Objects\u201d box, under transform set the Forward to X Forward, and the Up to Z Up and hit the Export FBX button.</p> <p></p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Assignment/Assignment%20I/#presentation","title":"Presentation","text":"<p>Now that you have finished your first 3D model you should present it and discuss in the live session.

However, before the modelling will start, object materials will be explained. You start this chapter with the default scene, where you can delete the camera and light. 1.  In the end, you want your building to have different materials, roofs should look different than for example glass or walls. When in edit mode of an object, the last tab in the properties bar is the material properties.</p> <pre><code>![](./Images/ib-12.png)\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>There is only one default material that is assigned to all the faces of the object. You can rename it by double clicking the name and you can change the base colour by clicking the correspond-ing bar. By default, you won\u2019t see this colour change, to see it change the viewport shading to material preview. You can do this in the upper right part of the viewport.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Now add a new material by pressing + sign in the material properties, then immediately press the + New button that shows up. You delete a material by selecting it and pressing the \u2013 button, this can only be done outside of edit mode.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Give the new material a colour different from the first material. To do that, make sure you have selected the correct material by simply clicking on it in the list of the material properties tab.</p> </li> <li> <p>Currently all the faces of the cube have the same material assigned, to change this, select a face of the cube, in the material list, click on the material you want to assign to the selection, and press Assign. The assign button assigns the selected material to your selection in the viewport. If you want to select all the faces with a certain material, you can use the Select button next to the Assign button.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>At the end of your modelling phase, but before exporting, you always have to check if your normals are all facing the correct way. Normals shows the program on which side of the face the material should be, so if you do not have them all facing the same way, some faces will be see-through. To check this, open the overlay settings menu in the upper right part of the viewport and enable the \u201cFace Orientation\u201d checkbox. Tip: in these settings you can also enable edge length and face area settings, this allows you to see the measurements of selected faces and edges.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>All sides of the cube should now show as the same colour. The sides that are visible from out-side should be blue. In more complex models, that may not always be the case, there are multi-ple ways to fix this. All are accessible in the normal menu, which you can access using alt+N, or in the toolbar using Mesh -&gt; Normals. You should always be in edit mode when changing nor-mals.</p> <ul> <li>With all faces selected, press \u201cRecalculate Outside\u201d</li> <li>With the wrong facing faces selected, press \u201cFlip\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Now that all your faces are facing the same way, the object must be setup in a way that complex materials with textures can be put on the model in blender or future programs. This is done in most programs using UV mapping, in simple terms, it is how a flat texture can be applied to a 3d model. You do that by cutting the model in a way that it can be made flat. Then the texture is applied by simply layering it on the flat model and then the model is folded back into its original shape. The UV map is the 2D representation of the model. For a basic cube, the UV map can be seen below. More information about UV unwrapping can be found online for example at: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/uv/introduction.html </p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Blender has a separate UV Editing tab, so select that in the toolbar, make sure that the object is in edit mode and have all faces selected (use A). The UV map will then show up on the left part of your screen. For a simple cube, blender already has the correct UV map, but if you for exam-ple change the model, using the methods of chapter 3, the UV map will no longer be correct. The dimensions will no longer be correct. You can fix this manually, which is not part of this tutorial, but information can be found at: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.79/editors/uv_image/uv/editing/unwrapping/seams.html. We will let blender to the work, so make sure all faces are selected, and in the toolbar select UV -&gt; Smart UV Project and press Ok. Below, you can see the difference.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>You could also only extrude certain parts of the model to create some parts of the buildings that are higher than others to add some more interesting parts to the building. Since you can only ex-trude complete faces, you might want to add some loop cuts and move them around to create smaller faces to add a floor to. Tip: if you want to see the lengths of the edges enable them in the overlay settings.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Since the water must leave the inside, the bottom floor of that level must be deleted. To do that, select the face at the underside of the building, extrude them up by the height of your floors and in the extrude settings, enable \u201cDissolve Orthogonal Edges\u201d to have Blender automatically delete the \u201cfloating\u201d walls. If that doesn\u2019t do the trick, you can manually delete the faces by selecting the bottom edge and deleting it. Don\u2019t forget that you can move the camera to your selection by pressing \u201c.\u201d on the numpad or in the toolbar press View -&gt; Frame Selected.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>This method can generate some double vertexes; therefore, it is wise to often merge the vertex-es that overlap. This can be done by selecting everything using A, pressing M and select By Dis-tance, this tool merges all vertexes that are within a certain distance. In the settings tab that pops us, make sure that the Merge Distance is not too large since this will merge vertexes that you do not want to merge.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now would be a good time to assign the first materials, to give yourself an easier job, make sure that you colour each material differently</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Let\u2019s now add windows, you can do this by selecting only the horizontal edges of a side and subdivide it as many times as you like. To make it yourself easier, already apply a new material to your selection. This way you will have a separate material for the frames of the windows. To do this afterwards takes a lot of time. Then inset the new windows, enable the \u201cIndividual\u201d setting and assign the selection to a new material for glass. Depth greatly enhances a model, so you can add depth to the model by extruding certain parts, for example, set the glass a bit back. Do this for all sides where you want windows or doors. Try to vary with materials, think about this in advance.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Now that the basic building is done, you can add additional details like an entrance etc.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>When you have finished your building, do not forget to check if all the faces are orientated cor-rectly and use smart UV unwrap to correct the UV\u2019s. Also remove excessive vertexes using merge by distance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now the building can be exported, you can export to many file types, but the programs you will use the FXB format. Export the building by selecting the object and go to File -&gt; Export -&gt; FBX (.fbx). Check the \u201cSelected Objects\u201d box, under transform set the Forward to X Forward, and the Up to Z Up and hit the Export FBX button.</p> <p></p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Assignment/Intro%20to%20blender/#_1","title":",","text":""},{"location":"Assignment/Intro%20to%20blender/#5-creating-a-building-using-basic-modelling-tools-in-blender","title":"5.

Don't worry\u2014we\u2019ll break down the concepts so they\u2019re easy to follow. Below are the key terms and ideas you'll encounter:</p> <p>What is Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET)? PET is a numerical value that combines variables like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation to estimate perceived thermal comfort. It helps us understand how weather conditions affect the human body.</p> <p>The PET model was developed to standardize urban heat maps, especially for climate stress tests in places like the Netherlands. These tests evaluate the effects of heat stress on infrastructure and society. Before PET, heat maps varied widely due to inconsistent methods and metrics. PET now provides a consistent way to identify hotspots and inform climate adaptation strategies.</p> <p>Using meteorological models and GIS tools, PET integrates data such as weather, urban layouts, and the urban heat island effect to produce detailed heat maps. It accounts for variables beyond air temperature, such as wind, humidity, and radiation, which significantly impact how humans experience heat. PET has been validated in studies and includes projections for future climate scenarios, making it a powerful tool for urban planning and decision-making.</p> <p>The formula proposed by Koopmans et al. is:</p> <p>\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b = \u221213.26 + 1.25\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4e + 0.011\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc60 \u2212 3.37 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc621.2 ) + 0.078\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc64 + 0.0055\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc621.2) +5.56 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udf11) \u2212 0.0103\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc621.2 ) \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udf11) + 0.54Bb + 1.94\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc63f</p> <p>Key Variables in PET 1.

Urban air temperature plays a significant role in thermal comfort.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Humidity (\u03c6) Represents the amount of moisture in the air. High humidity makes it feel hotter, while low humidity makes it feel cooler.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wind Speed (u\u2081.\u2082) Measures how fast air is moving, usually expressed in meters per second (m/s).

Here's an explanation of the colour and shape meanings for each item in Model Builder:</p> <p>a.  Tool: Tools are represented by rectangular icons on the canvas. They perform geoprocessing operations or analyses. The colour of the tool icon is typically blue.</p> <p>b.  Variable: Variables are represented by oval icons on the canvas. They store data or values used as inputs or outputs in your model. The colour of the variable icon is typically green.</p> <p>c.  Input: Inputs are represented by thin, solid lines connecting the outputs of one tool or variable to the inputs of another tool. The input line is usually black.</p> <p>d.  Output: Outputs are represented by thick, solid lines connecting the outputs of a tool or variable to the inputs of another tool or variable. The output line is usually black.</p> <p>e.  Model Parameter: Model parameters are inputs or outputs that can be configured when running the model. They are represented by a small flag icon attached to the tool or variable. The colour of the flag icon is typically purple.</p> <p>f.  Derived Output: Derived outputs are outputs that are generated by a tool but not explicitly connected to other tools. They are represented by dashed lines connecting the output of a tool to the canvas. The dashed line is usually black.</p> <p>g.  Branch: A branch represents a logical flow in the model where one set of tools or operations is executed based on a conditional statement. It is represented by a diamond-shaped icon. The colour of the branch icon is typically orange.</p> <p>h.  Model Label: Model labels are used to provide descriptive text or comments on the canvas. They are represented by rectangular boxes with a folded corner. The colour of the model label icon is typically gray.</p> <p>These colour and shape conventions help visually distinguish between different elements in your model, making it easier to understand the structure and flow of your geoprocessing workflows in Model Builder. By utilizing these visual cues, you can quickly identify tools, variables, inputs, outputs, branches, and labels, facilitating the design and comprehension of your models.</p> <p>You should also get familiar with actions, including adding variables, tools, defining inputs and outputs, and linking them together:</p> <p>a.  Opening Model Builder: To start using Model Builder, open ArcGIS Pro and create or open a project. Then, navigate to the \"Analysis\" tab on the ribbon and click on the \"ModelBuilder\" button to launch the Model Builder interface.</p> <p>b.  Adding Variables: Variables represent the data or values that will be used as inputs or outputs in your model. To add a variable, you can either right-click on the canvas or click on the \"Add Variable\" button in the Model Builder toolbar. Specify the variable's name, data type, and any other necessary properties. Variables can be used to store input data, intermediate results, or output data.</p> <p>c.  Adding Tools: Tools represent geoprocessing operations that perform specific tasks or analyses. To add a tool to your model, you can either search for it in the \"Toolbox\" pane and drag it onto the canvas or click on the \"Insert\" button in the Model Builder toolbar and choose the desired tool from the list. Each tool has its own set of parameters that you can configure based on your requirements.</p> <p>d.  Defining Inputs: Inputs are the data or variables that you provide to the tools for analysis. To define an input for a tool, you can either drag a variable from the Variables pane onto the tool or right-click on the tool and choose \"Model Parameter\" to create a new input variable. Inputs can be features, rasters, tables, or any other applicable data type.</p> <p>e.  Defining Outputs: Outputs are the results generated by the tools in your model. To define an output, you can either right-click on a tool and choose \"Model Parameter\" or drag an existing variable to the tool. Outputs can be specified as variables, allowing you to use them as inputs for subsequent tools or store them as final results.</p> <p>f.  Linking Inputs and Outputs: To connect the inputs and outputs between tools, you can click and drag from the output of one tool to the input of another tool. This establishes the flow of data and dependencies within your model. You can also link inputs and outputs to variables by dragging connections to or from the variables on the canvas.</p> <p>g.  Configuring Tool Parameters: For each tool in your model, you can double-click on it to open its properties dialog. Here, you can configure the tool's parameters, such as specifying input datasets, setting analysis options, defining output locations, and adjusting any other relevant settings.</p> <p>h.  Running the Model: Once you have built and configured your model, you can run it by clicking on the \"Run\" button in the Model Builder toolbar. This will execute each tool in the model in the defined order, passing inputs and collecting outputs as specified. You can monitor the progress and view any generated messages or warnings during the execution.</p> <p>Note: It is also important to know that some variables and features will need to be set as \u201cParameter\u201d in the Model Builder, this can be done by right clicking it and setting the green check on in the menu that will pop up. Whenever you do this a small P will appear beside your feature or variable letting you know which ones have or have not been set already. Now you know what we mean when we ask you to set a variable or feature as parameter.</p> <p></p> <p>In Model Builder, setting features and variables as parameters is like making your geoprocessing model flexible and customizable. Parameters allow you to input different values or datasets when running the model, without having to modify the model itself. It's like having adjustable dials on a control panel. Have you seen when a program asks you to input a name or a file before running a process? This is what you will be able to achieve when you set inputs as parameters. This flexibility makes your model more versatile and adaptable to different scenarios. It's like giving your model a set of knobs and switches so that you can fine-tune its behaviour for specific needs without rebuilding it from scratch.</p> <p>By utilizing variables, tools, inputs, outputs, and linking them together, Model Builder allows you to create complex geoprocessing workflows in a visual and intuitive manner. This empowers you to automate repetitive tasks, streamline analyses, and improve efficiency in your GIS workflows.</p>"},{"location":"Assignment/Tutorial%203/#3-how-to-add-each-different-pet-input-to-your-model-builder","title":"3.

The cell size determines the level of resolution and precision in your data. Smaller cell sizes provide finer details and accuracy, but require more storage and processing power. On the other hand, larger cell sizes sacrifice some detail but are more efficient in terms of storage and processing. So, choosing the right cell size is important to balance data quality and performance in your GIS analysis and mapping tasks. </p> <p>This cell size must remain as similar as possible within all the processes we will do in the project to avoid as much as possible to miscalculate our results.

Give your toolbox a name and click OK.</p> <p>2)  Customize the Toolbox: Now that you have created the toolbox, you can start customizing it by adding tools and scripts. Right-click on the toolbox and select New &gt; Script. This will create a new script tool within the toolbox.</p> <p>3)  Right click  on the script/ Properties/Parameters to define the input parameters for the script tool, which should include:</p> <p>a.
