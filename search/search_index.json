So we will ad the sur-roundings of the campus to the background. For this you need an image of the surrounding ar-ea. You could take this from QGIS, OSM, Google, etc. you can find an image. Save that image and simply drag it into your Blender viewport (no georeferencing), the image will be placed per-fectly in front of you.</p> <p>Since you want the reference to be on the ground in this case, make sure you are looking at the model perfectly from above (see step 3.).

But since the OSM uses a different coordinate system, first the road network needs to be converted to RD new.

The easiest way to do this is by right click-ing the road layer and press <code>Export -&gt; Save Features As\u2026</code> Give it a logical file name and make sure that the CRS is set to RD new, then press OK. You can now delete the old road layer (you do not have to apply the changes).</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Now the road network would be ready to have the buffer applied, however, not every road type has the same width. So, the width of a road will be decided by its attributes. The attributes of a feature can be found by pressing the Identify Features button in the Toolbar. Then click on one of the roads for example on the Hengelosestraat. To the right, you can see that features attrib-utes.

The following code can be used: <code>\"maxspeed\" = '50' AND \"highway\" = 'primary' AND \u201cBuffered\u201d is NULL</code>.

Decide on a distance of the road, which should be half the total width you want it to be. You could for example use google earth to measure the distance on the satellite image. Also set the End cap style to flat and press run.

However, before the modelling will start, object materials will be explained. You start this chapter with the default scene, where you can delete the camera and light. 1.  In the end, you want your building to have different materials, roofs should look different than for example glass or walls. When in edit mode of an object, the last tab in the properties bar is the material properties.</p> <pre><code>![](./Images/ib-12.png)\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>There is only one default material that is assigned to all the faces of the object. You can rename it by double clicking the name and you can change the base colour by clicking the correspond-ing bar. By default, you won\u2019t see this colour change, to see it change the viewport shading to material preview. You can do this in the upper right part of the viewport.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Now add a new material by pressing + sign in the material properties, then immediately press the + New button that shows up. You delete a material by selecting it and pressing the \u2013 button, this can only be done outside of edit mode.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Give the new material a colour different from the first material. To do that, make sure you have selected the correct material by simply clicking on it in the list of the material properties tab.</p> </li> <li> <p>Currently all the faces of the cube have the same material assigned, to change this, select a face of the cube, in the material list, click on the material you want to assign to the selection, and press Assign. The assign button assigns the selected material to your selection in the viewport. If you want to select all the faces with a certain material, you can use the Select button next to the Assign button.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>At the end of your modelling phase, but before exporting, you always have to check if your normals are all facing the correct way. Normals shows the program on which side of the face the material should be, so if you do not have them all facing the same way, some faces will be see-through. To check this, open the overlay settings menu in the upper right part of the viewport and enable the \u201cFace Orientation\u201d checkbox. Tip: in these settings you can also enable edge length and face area settings, this allows you to see the measurements of selected faces and edges.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>All sides of the cube should now show as the same colour. The sides that are visible from out-side should be blue. In more complex models, that may not always be the case, there are multi-ple ways to fix this. All are accessible in the normal menu, which you can access using alt+N, or in the toolbar using Mesh -&gt; Normals. You should always be in edit mode when changing nor-mals.</p> <ul> <li>With all faces selected, press \u201cRecalculate Outside\u201d</li> <li>With the wrong facing faces selected, press \u201cFlip\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Now that all your faces are facing the same way, the object must be setup in a way that complex materials with textures can be put on the model in blender or future programs. This is done in most programs using UV mapping, in simple terms, it is how a flat texture can be applied to a 3d model. You do that by cutting the model in a way that it can be made flat. Then the texture is applied by simply layering it on the flat model and then the model is folded back into its original shape. The UV map is the 2D representation of the model. For a basic cube, the UV map can be seen below. More information about UV unwrapping can be found online for example at: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/uv/introduction.html </p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Blender has a separate UV Editing tab, so select that in the toolbar, make sure that the object is in edit mode and have all faces selected (use A). The UV map will then show up on the left part of your screen. For a simple cube, blender already has the correct UV map, but if you for exam-ple change the model, using the methods of chapter 3, the UV map will no longer be correct. The dimensions will no longer be correct. You can fix this manually, which is not part of this tutorial, but information can be found at: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.79/editors/uv_image/uv/editing/unwrapping/seams.html. We will let blender to the work, so make sure all faces are selected, and in the toolbar select UV -&gt; Smart UV Project and press Ok. Below, you can see the difference.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>You could also only extrude certain parts of the model to create some parts of the buildings that are higher than others to add some more interesting parts to the building. Since you can only ex-trude complete faces, you might want to add some loop cuts and move them around to create smaller faces to add a floor to. Tip: if you want to see the lengths of the edges enable them in the overlay settings.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Since the water must leave the inside, the bottom floor of that level must be deleted. To do that, select the face at the underside of the building, extrude them up by the height of your floors and in the extrude settings, enable \u201cDissolve Orthogonal Edges\u201d to have Blender automatically delete the \u201cfloating\u201d walls. If that doesn\u2019t do the trick, you can manually delete the faces by selecting the bottom edge and deleting it. Don\u2019t forget that you can move the camera to your selection by pressing \u201c.\u201d on the numpad or in the toolbar press View -&gt; Frame Selected.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>This method can generate some double vertexes; therefore, it is wise to often merge the vertex-es that overlap. This can be done by selecting everything using A, pressing M and select By Dis-tance, this tool merges all vertexes that are within a certain distance. In the settings tab that pops us, make sure that the Merge Distance is not too large since this will merge vertexes that you do not want to merge.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now would be a good time to assign the first materials, to give yourself an easier job, make sure that you colour each material differently</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Let\u2019s now add windows, you can do this by selecting only the horizontal edges of a side and subdivide it as many times as you like. To make it yourself easier, already apply a new material to your selection. This way you will have a separate material for the frames of the windows. To do this afterwards takes a lot of time. Then inset the new windows, enable the \u201cIndividual\u201d setting and assign the selection to a new material for glass. Depth greatly enhances a model, so you can add depth to the model by extruding certain parts, for example, set the glass a bit back. Do this for all sides where you want windows or doors. Try to vary with materials, think about this in advance.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Now that the basic building is done, you can add additional details like an entrance etc.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>When you have finished your building, do not forget to check if all the faces are orientated cor-rectly and use smart UV unwrap to correct the UV\u2019s. Also remove excessive vertexes using merge by distance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now the building can be exported, you can export to many file types, but the programs you will use the FXB format. Export the building by selecting the object and go to File -&gt; Export -&gt; FBX (.fbx). Check the \u201cSelected Objects\u201d box, under transform set the Forward to X Forward, and the Up to Z Up and hit the Export FBX button.</p> <p></p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Assignment/Intro%20to%20blender/#_1","title":",","text":""},{"location":"Assignment/Intro%20to%20blender/#5-creating-a-building-using-basic-modelling-tools-in-blender","title":"5.

Don't worry\u2014we\u2019ll break down the concepts so they\u2019re easy to follow. Below are the key terms and ideas you'll encounter:</p> <p>What is Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET)? PET is a numerical value that combines variables like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation to estimate perceived thermal comfort. It helps us understand how weather conditions affect the human body.</p> <p>The PET model was developed to standardize urban heat maps, especially for climate stress tests in places like the Netherlands. These tests evaluate the effects of heat stress on infrastructure and society. Before PET, heat maps varied widely due to inconsistent methods and metrics. PET now provides a consistent way to identify hotspots and inform climate adaptation strategies.</p> <p>Using meteorological models and GIS tools, PET integrates data such as weather, urban layouts, and the urban heat island effect to produce detailed heat maps. It accounts for variables beyond air temperature, such as wind, humidity, and radiation, which significantly impact how humans experience heat. PET has been validated in studies and includes projections for future climate scenarios, making it a powerful tool for urban planning and decision-making.</p> <p>The formula proposed by Koopmans et al. is:</p> <p>\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b = \u221213.26 + 1.25\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4e + 0.011\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc60 \u2212 3.37 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc621.2 ) + 0.078\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc64 + 0.0055\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc621.2) +5.56 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udf11) \u2212 0.0103\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc621.2 ) \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udf11) + 0.54Bb + 1.94\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc63f</p> <p>Key Variables in PET 1.

Urban air temperature plays a significant role in thermal comfort.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Humidity (\u03c6) Represents the amount of moisture in the air. High humidity makes it feel hotter, while low humidity makes it feel cooler.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wind Speed (u\u2081.\u2082) Measures how fast air is moving, usually expressed in meters per second (m/s).

This influences temperature, weather patterns, and thermal comfort.</p> </li> <li> <p>Solar Elevation Angle (\u03c6) Indicates the Sun's height above the horizon, changing throughout the day and year. It affects the intensity of solar radiation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sky View Factor (Svf) Measures how much of the sky is visible from a given point. Areas with more visible sky (Svf closer to 1) receive more direct sunlight, while obstructed areas (Svf closer to 0) stay cooler.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bowen Ratio (Bb) Describes the balance between heat transferred through warming air (sensible heat) and evaporating moisture (latent heat).

Here's an explanation of the colour and shape meanings for each item in Model Builder:</p> <p>a.  Tool: Tools are represented by rectangular icons on the canvas. They perform geoprocessing operations or analyses. The colour of the tool icon is typically blue.</p> <p>b.  Variable: Variables are represented by oval icons on the canvas. They store data or values used as inputs or outputs in your model. The colour of the variable icon is typically green.</p> <p>c.  Input: Inputs are represented by thin, solid lines connecting the outputs of one tool or variable to the inputs of another tool. The input line is usually black.</p> <p>d.  Output: Outputs are represented by thick, solid lines connecting the outputs of a tool or variable to the inputs of another tool or variable. The output line is usually black.</p> <p>e.  Model Parameter: Model parameters are inputs or outputs that can be configured when running the model. They are represented by a small flag icon attached to the tool or variable. The colour of the flag icon is typically purple.</p> <p>f.  Derived Output: Derived outputs are outputs that are generated by a tool but not explicitly connected to other tools. They are represented by dashed lines connecting the output of a tool to the canvas. The dashed line is usually black.</p> <p>g.  Branch: A branch represents a logical flow in the model where one set of tools or operations is executed based on a conditional statement. It is represented by a diamond-shaped icon. The colour of the branch icon is typically orange.</p> <p>h.  Model Label: Model labels are used to provide descriptive text or comments on the canvas. They are represented by rectangular boxes with a folded corner. The colour of the model label icon is typically gray.</p> <p>These colour and shape conventions help visually distinguish between different elements in your model, making it easier to understand the structure and flow of your geoprocessing workflows in Model Builder. By utilizing these visual cues, you can quickly identify tools, variables, inputs, outputs, branches, and labels, facilitating the design and comprehension of your models.</p> <p>You should also get familiar with actions, including adding variables, tools, defining inputs and outputs, and linking them together:</p> <p>a.  Opening Model Builder: To start using Model Builder, open ArcGIS Pro and create or open a project. Then, navigate to the \"Analysis\" tab on the ribbon and click on the \"ModelBuilder\" button to launch the Model Builder interface.</p> <p>b.  Adding Variables: Variables represent the data or values that will be used as inputs or outputs in your model. To add a variable, you can either right-click on the canvas or click on the \"Add Variable\" button in the Model Builder toolbar. Specify the variable's name, data type, and any other necessary properties. Variables can be used to store input data, intermediate results, or output data.</p> <p>c.  Adding Tools: Tools represent geoprocessing operations that perform specific tasks or analyses. To add a tool to your model, you can either search for it in the \"Toolbox\" pane and drag it onto the canvas or click on the \"Insert\" button in the Model Builder toolbar and choose the desired tool from the list. Each tool has its own set of parameters that you can configure based on your requirements.</p> <p>d.  Defining Inputs: Inputs are the data or variables that you provide to the tools for analysis. To define an input for a tool, you can either drag a variable from the Variables pane onto the tool or right-click on the tool and choose \"Model Parameter\" to create a new input variable. Inputs can be features, rasters, tables, or any other applicable data type.</p> <p>e.  Defining Outputs: Outputs are the results generated by the tools in your model. To define an output, you can either right-click on a tool and choose \"Model Parameter\" or drag an existing variable to the tool. Outputs can be specified as variables, allowing you to use them as inputs for subsequent tools or store them as final results.</p> <p>f.  Linking Inputs and Outputs: To connect the inputs and outputs between tools, you can click and drag from the output of one tool to the input of another tool. This establishes the flow of data and dependencies within your model. You can also link inputs and outputs to variables by dragging connections to or from the variables on the canvas.</p> <p>g.  Configuring Tool Parameters: For each tool in your model, you can double-click on it to open its properties dialog. Here, you can configure the tool's parameters, such as specifying input datasets, setting analysis options, defining output locations, and adjusting any other relevant settings.</p> <p>h.  Running the Model: Once you have built and configured your model, you can run it by clicking on the \"Run\" button in the Model Builder toolbar. This will execute each tool in the model in the defined order, passing inputs and collecting outputs as specified. You can monitor the progress and view any generated messages or warnings during the execution.</p> <p>Note: It is also important to know that some variables and features will need to be set as \u201cParameter\u201d in the Model Builder, this can be done by right clicking it and setting the green check on in the menu that will pop up. Whenever you do this a small P will appear beside your feature or variable letting you know which ones have or have not been set already. Now you know what we mean when we ask you to set a variable or feature as parameter.</p> <p></p> <p>In Model Builder, setting features and variables as parameters is like making your geoprocessing model flexible and customizable. Parameters allow you to input different values or datasets when running the model, without having to modify the model itself. It's like having adjustable dials on a control panel. Have you seen when a program asks you to input a name or a file before running a process? This is what you will be able to achieve when you set inputs as parameters. This flexibility makes your model more versatile and adaptable to different scenarios. It's like giving your model a set of knobs and switches so that you can fine-tune its behaviour for specific needs without rebuilding it from scratch.</p> <p>By utilizing variables, tools, inputs, outputs, and linking them together, Model Builder allows you to create complex geoprocessing workflows in a visual and intuitive manner.

So, choosing the right cell size is important to balance data quality and performance in your GIS analysis and mapping tasks. </p> <p>This cell size must remain as similar as possible within all the processes we will do in the project to avoid as much as possible to miscalculate our results. To achieve this, you can add the Cell Size as a variable and selecting the data type as \u201cCell Size\u201d.  </p> <p>You will see your variable appear in your model builder and you will be able to double click it to assign it a predefined value (this value will depend on your Coordinate System, as we are using the Amersfoort / RD New (EPSG:28992) our variable will be considered in meters).

It's like putting a frame around a picture to zoom in on a specific region. The analysis extent determines the spatial coverage of your analysis and limits it to a specific area of interest. By setting the analysis extent, you can narrow down your study area and concentrate your analysis on the relevant geographic features within that boundary. It helps you zoom in on the details that matter and avoid unnecessary computations on areas outside of your interest. So, it's like putting on a pair of virtual glasses to narrow your focus and analyse the world within a specific window.</p> <p>This \u201cwindow\u201d can help us select the desired area to be calculated for our PET analysis and help us do faster calculations localized only on our area of interest.

If by any chance you haven\u2019t done this by now, this is a good moment to do it. Also if you need to refresh your memory on how the PET equation looks you can always check the Section 2: Understanding the Science Behind PET.  As we told you before we will start by doing our first calculation inside of the ModelBuilder.

When working with multiple datasets in GIS, they may not always align perfectly due to differences in resolution or grid orientation. Snap rasters help ensure that all your datasets line up seamlessly. It's like using a magnetic board to align puzzle pieces. By setting a snap raster, your data snaps to its grid, making sure that each cell matches up precisely with other datasets. This alignment is important for accurate analysis and smooth visualization.

As we did with the \u201cExtent\u201d and \u201cCell Size\u201d variables we can add some new variables that we will use and used them. To start, simply add the following variables, remember that you add them directly from the Insert menu in the ModelBuilder tab and then you select the type of data you want to add:</p> <ul> <li>Date: For this case you select the Date data type. Be sure to make it a parameter. If  you open it you will have the option to add a date and time.

Then if it is not available we can create our own geoprocessing tools and do calculations within ArcGIS PRO. Don\u2019t worry, there is a code already prepared by us that will take the basic calculations of the Solar Radiation Angle and apply it to our recently created variables. In order to convert the code into a geoprocessing tool that can take user inputs and perform the same operation, the following steps can be done: 1)  Create a new Python Toolbox in ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap:</li> </ul> <p>a Open the Catalog Pane: In ArcGIS Pro, you can find the Catalog Pane on the right-hand side of the application interface. Click on the Catalog button to open it. In ArcMap, go to the Customize menu and select Catalog Pane to open it.</p> <p>b.    Create a new Toolbox: In the Catalog Pane, navigate to the location where you want to create your new Python Toolbox. Right-click on that location and select New &gt; Toolbox. Give your toolbox a name and click OK.</p> <p>2)  Customize the Toolbox: Now that you have created the toolbox, you can start customizing it by adding tools and scripts. Right-click on the toolbox and select New &gt; Script. This will create a new script tool within the toolbox.</p> <p>3)  Right click  on the script/ Properties/Parameters to define the input parameters for the script tool, which should include:</p> <p>a. Input date (Date type): Select the value as required and the direction should be set as an input. </p> <p>b. Input latitude (Double): Select the value as required and the direction should be set as an input. You can set your latitude value in the default column. </p> <p>c.    Input longitude (Double): Select the value as required and the direction should be set as an input. You can set your longitude value in the default column.</p> <p>d.    Output Angle (Double): Select the value as derived and the direction should be set as an output. </p> <p>4)  Examine the script tool code and paste the provided code in Chapter 2 Section 1  5)  Save the toolbox and test the tool in model builder. 6)  The result will be a decimal number that will be used in the PET equation later on.</p> <p> </p> <p>It was easy right? Now that you know the basics we can move on into operations that will need multiple variables and geoprocessing tools together.
