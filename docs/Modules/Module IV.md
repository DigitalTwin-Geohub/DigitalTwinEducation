## Exercise 4 (20 points)

#### PROCESS AND ANALYSIS - Write one to two pages (include at least three diagrams, a conceptual framework, a use-case diagram, and a data-flow diagram, take a look at the [Gemini Principles](https://www.cdbb.cam.ac.uk/DFTG/GeminiPrinciples) ♊, you can follow the example of the [EquiCity Game](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-61093-4) 🎮 for the diagrams and use the free tool [Draw.IO](https://www.drawio.com/)✒️ for creating them)

*  What are your user stories? ▶️ Represent the specific added value of your digital planning tool in a [Use-Case Diagram](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/use-case-diagram/) and describe it briefly in text.
*  How do you want to translate the questions and problems of users to queries and data processing functions? ▶️ Represent your data processing pipelines as a [Data Flow Diagram](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/what-is-dfddata-flow-diagram/) and describe it briefly in text.
*  Describe the overall Conceptual Framework e.g. based on the [DPSIR framework](https://www.ecoshape.org/en/tools/framework-for-system-understanding-dpsir/about/)
    * Which human decisions or natural condition variables can be assumed as **driver** forces that affect the outcomes of interest (a.k.a. performance indicators or impact factors or policy targets, among other names)?
    *  What is the **pressures** genereted by these conditions?
    *  What are the **states** or conditions of the environment affected by the pressures?
    *  What are the **impacts** either biological, social, economic or environmental that the change of state create?
    *  What are possible key indicators that stakeholders would need to **respond** to the changes in the system?

* Create a Flowchart explaining [the relationships of the previous items](https://learningforsustainability.net/post/extended-dpsir/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), identify which are inputs and outputs.  Remember using the outputs from preparation Assignment 3.
* Review if you require more data for completing your model.

## Live office hour
