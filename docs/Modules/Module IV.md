## Assignment 4 (non graded)

#### PROCESS AND ANALYSIS - Write one to two pages

*  How could data interact to achieve your goal? 
*  Which human influences or natural conditions can be **driver** forces that affect your study area?
*  What is the **pressures** genereted by these conditions?
*  What are the **states** or conditions of the environment affected by the pressures?
*  What are the **impacts** either biological, social, economic or environmental that the change of state create?
*  What are possible key indicators that stakeholders would need to **respond** to the changes in the system?

* Create a Flowchart explaining the relationships of the previous items, identify which are inputs and outputs.  Remember using the outputs from preparation Assignment 3.
* Review if you require more data for completing your model.
