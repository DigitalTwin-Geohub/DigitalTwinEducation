## Assignment

For this week your assignment is to transform a point cloud into a 3D object [Assignment 2](../Assignment/Assignment%20II.md).

## Preparation for Final Assignment


#### COLLECTION AND INTERACTION - Write one to two pages

*	What data would you need for your digital twin? 
*	Which data is available? Explain which data is OpenSource and which one is propietary. Where and how can you access to these data? 
*	Download 3D objects or LIDAR data from your study area (show source and describe the data. Include images)
*	Download supplementary data (what type of data, show source and describe data)
